The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE. 
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.

The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

-> The GROUP BY : used to group the result set
statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

-> ORDER BY
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

-> HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
Its necessary that we always use HAVING clause with GROUP BY clause & evaluated after forming group.
Syntax: SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);

Eg. select name,salary from employee having salary>30000 group by name,salary;
